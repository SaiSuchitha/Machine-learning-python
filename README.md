# Machine-learning-python- Disease Prediction


Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning is a system that predicts diseases based on symptoms provided by patients or other users. The system takes the symptoms entered by the user as input and outputs the probability of the disease.
The goal of developing this project titled "Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning" is to accurately predict the disease of the patient using all of their general information as well as their symptoms.
The health industry is still lacking in information and knowledge, and it is a massive industry with a lot of work to be done. So, with the help of all those algorithms, techniques, and methodologies, we've completed this project that can assist those in need.

In this project all the models of Machine Learning are applied on the Disease Prediction dataset taken from the Kaggle. The dataset comprises of 133 columns and 132 varied symptoms experienced by patients suffering from a disease. This dataset is a clean dataset with no null values and all the features consist of 0’s and 1’s and the target variable are Prognosis.
